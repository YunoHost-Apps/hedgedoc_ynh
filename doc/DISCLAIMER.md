## Configuration

You can configure HedgeDoc by editing this file `/var/www/hedgedoc/config.json` using the [documentation](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/blob/master/docs/configuration.md)  
When you finished editing the configuration, for your changes to take effect, you will have to run: `sudo systemctl restart hedgedoc`.
